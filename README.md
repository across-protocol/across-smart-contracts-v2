# Across V2

Contains smart contract suite to enable instant token transfers between any two networks. Relays are backstopped by
liquidity held in a central `HubPool` on Ethereum, which also serves as the cross-chain administrator of all contracts in the
system. `SpokePool` contracts are deployed to any network that wants to originate token deposits or be the final
destination for token transfers, and they are all governed by the `HubPool` on Ethereum.

This contract set is the second iteration of the [Across smart contracts](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-smart-contracts)
which facilitate token transfers from any L2 to L1.

## Build

```shell
yarn
yarn hardhat compile
```

## Test

```shell
yarn test # Run unit tests without gas analysis
yarn test:gas-analytics # Run only tests that count gas costs
yarn test:report-gas # Run unit tests with hardhat-gas-reporter enabled
```

## Lint

```shell
yarn lint
yarn lint-fix
```

## Deploy and Verify

```shell
NODE_URL_1=https://mainnet.infura.com/xxx yarn hardhat deploy --tags HubPool --network mainnet
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=XXX yarn hardhat etherscan-verify --network mainnet --license AGPL-3.0 --force-license --solc-input
```

## Performance optimizations

For faster runs of your tests and scripts, consider skipping ts-node's type checking by setting the environment variable `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY` to `1` in hardhat's environment. For more details see [the documentation](https://hardhat.org/guides/typescript.html#performance-optimizations).
