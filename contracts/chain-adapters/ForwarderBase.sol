/**
 * @title ForwarderBase
 * @notice This contract expects to receive messages and tokens from an authorized sender on L1 and forwards messages and tokens to spoke pool contracts on
 * L3. Messages are intended to originate from the hub pool. The motivating use case for this contract is to aid with sending messages from L1 to an L3, which
 * by definition is a network which does not have a direct connection with L1 but instead must communicate with that L1 via an L2. Each contract that extends
 * the ForwarderBase maintains a mapping of chain IDs to a bridge adapter addresses. For example, if this contract is deployed on Arbitrum, then this mapping
 * would send L3 chain IDs which roll up to Arbitrum to an adapter contract address deployed on Arbitrum which directly interfaces with the L3 token/message
 * bridge. In other words, this contract maintains a mapping of important contracts which helps transmit messages to the "next layer".
